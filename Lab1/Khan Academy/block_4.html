        <h2>Day</h2>
        <p id="day">
            Every day brings a new opportunity to learn and grow. 
            The challenges we face may seem difficult, but they shape us into stronger and wiser individuals. 
            It's important to stay positive, appreciate small victories, and believe in the power of perseverance. 
            Success isn’t always about the destination—it’s about the progress and lessons gained throughout the journey.
        </p>
        <h2>Time</h2>
        <p id="time">
            Time moves forward, whether we notice or not. 
            Each moment is a chance to make a difference, no matter how small. 
            Sometimes, the quiet efforts we put in today bloom into the biggest rewards tomorrow. 
            Life isn’t about rushing to the finish line; 
            it’s about embracing the experiences, connections, and memories that shape who we are.
